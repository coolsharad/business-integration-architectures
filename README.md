# Business Integration Architectures

This repository documents real-world backend integration architecture patterns based on production experience.

The focus is on business process integration, API workflows, and scalable backend design.

## Case Studies

1. WhatsApp Business API Integration
2. Amazon Seller Inventory Synchronization
3. AWS Integration Patterns
4. Payment Gateway Integrations

Detailed architectural explanations and code samples will be added progressively.

Note:
Modern automation tools like n8n, Zapier, or workflow engines can accelerate integration workflows. 
However, this repository focuses on backend-level architecture patterns used when custom control, 
scalability, and deeper integration are required.
